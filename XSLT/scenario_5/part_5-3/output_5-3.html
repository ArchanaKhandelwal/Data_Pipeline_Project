<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Place the oats and almond meal in a food processor. Grind for 30 seconds or until a flour-like substance forms. There should be about 1 cup of this mixture.</li>
<li>Transfer to a large mixing bowl and stir in the flour. Add the milk, egg, vanilla, brown sugar, and salt. Whisk for 20 seconds or until smooth and incorporated.</li>
<li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over low heat. Pour about 1/4 cup batter onto the pan. Carefully swirl the batter around the pan once to spread the batter out for a larger, more thin crepe. Cook until the edges of the crepe come up easily with a spatula. Carefully loosen the crepe around the edges and then inward to the center until the crepe releases from the pan; remove and set aside. Repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
<li>Stuff the crepes with sliced bananas and whatever else you like. Iâ€™d recommend almond butter, peanut butter, blueberries, strawberries, vanilla yogurt, cottage cheese, and ricotta cheese. Drizzle with the melted chocolate and serve warm or cold!</li>

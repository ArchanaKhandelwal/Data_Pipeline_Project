<h2>Recipe Name: 7-Layer Beet Salad</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>20</p>
<p><strong>FAQs:</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can I use something besides ricotta?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Yes! Try full fat plain yogurt instead. If you want a dairy-free option, use an almond-based product like Kite Hill dip or spread instead.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>What kind of beets do you buy?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>It’s easiest to use pre-cooked beets (Love Beets brand is perfect and sold at many grocery stores); otherwise, you can steam your own beets. Red or golden beets can work in this salad!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How do you cut your oranges?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>To do what’s called “supreme an orange”, cut the bottom off so it rests flat on your cutting board. Then cut around the sides to remove the peel and white layer. Finally, cut the centers into rounds.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Featured Comment:</strong>Made this for lunch today and it was delish! I used plain ricotta (salted and peppered) with arugula for my greens dressed in a maple balsamic. I was able to get some Cara Cara oranges to use it in too, yum! I didn’t have pistachios, so I used sunflower seeds instead which worked great to add a little nuttiness and crunch. Will definitely be making this one again, and love how you can swap in what you have and it’s still tasty</p>
<h2>Recipe Name: Harissa Meatballs with Whipped Feta</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>37</p>
<p><strong>FAQs:</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>What type of store-bought meatballs do you recommend?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Any kind! I’ve tried pork, beef, chicken, and turkey meatballs – and I think veggie meatballs would also work really well as a vegetarian option! This recipe is very forgiving – it can work with meatballs that are pre-cooked, and I’ve also enjoyed this recipe with the pre-made, UNCOOKED meatballs that you can often buy in the meat department. For a specific brand, I really enjoyed these with the ALDI pre-made uncooked Italian style meatballs (I know, wrong flavor profile, but it worked just fine and the meatballs were amazing). I just brushed them with the harissa sauce before baking.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>I have some extra time. Can I make my own meatballs for this recipe?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Sure can! These baked chicken meatballs are perfect in this recipe, and major bonus – they’re freezer-friendly if you wanted to prep these ahead of time. Doubling the recipe is not a bad idea!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Is harissa paste spicy?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>It’s not terribly spicy, but harissa paste does pack some heat. I would rate it as mild+ or medium- level heat. I left a few meatballs un-sauced for my toddler just to make sure it wasn’t too spicy for her.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>I can’t find harissa paste. What else can I use?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Chili oil or even sriracha could work here instead! Just adjust the amounts as necessary so that you don’t make it too spicy.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Featured Comment:</strong>I saw this when I woke up this morning and immediately knew what we were having for dinner. I didn’t have meatballs so I made some with leftover chicken. It was the nicest meal I’ve had in months. Thank you.</p>
<h2>Recipe Name: Easy Instant Pot Applesauce</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>4</p>
<p><strong>FAQs:</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can you make this on the stovetop?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Yes – you can cook this over medium heat for 20-30 minutes until the apples are soft.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can you make this in a slow cooker?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Yes – you can cook this on high for 4 hours in a slow cooker.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>What type of apples are best for applesauce?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Any will do, but I prefer Honeycrisp!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How long does this keep in the fridge?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>This will keep for 4-5 days in the fridge.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can I use ground cinnamon instead of cinnamon sticks?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Yes! Sub in 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon instead.</p>
</div>
<h2>Recipe Name: Instant Pot Italian Beef Sandwiches</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>29</p>

<h2>Recipe Name: Almond Oat Banana Crepes</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>8</p>
<h2>Recipe Name: Cashew Golden Milk Latte</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>7</p>

<h2>Recipe Name: English Muffin Baklava</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>10</p>
<p><strong>FAQs:</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>What can I use instead of English muffins?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>You could easily make this on any kind of toasted bread – or maybe even crackers?! Yum!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How long does the nut topping last?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>I usually make it all at once, but the nut mixture should last a day or two in the fridge – the texture might just change a little as the nuts soften.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How do you make this gluten-free and/or dairy-free?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Use a gluten-free English muffin for a gluten-free version! Use dairy-free butter and skip the mascarpone cheese for a dairy-free version.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can you make this without a broiler?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>A kitchen torch might be a bit intense for a little snack like this, but it would definitely work to toast and caramelize the topping! A toaster oven would also work great.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>What makes this like baklava?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>The use of pistachios and walnuts, butter, and honey gives it a texture and a flavor that is reminiscent of baklava! Not the same thing by any means – baklava is a very involved, multi-layered, multi-textured dessert made with phyllo (it’s epic). But this is like the budget version for those of us who just want the taste of it in a quick breakfast or snack.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Featured Comment:</strong>Wow! Yum yum yum! I made these for a girls night and everyone raves about them! Pretty easy to make and just so delicious . So fun to bring to parties and they don’t need to be served hot! Will definitely be making again! Thanks!!!</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can I use graham cracker crust instead of Oreo crust?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Sure! That would be delicious!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can I make this dairy-free?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Yes! Just use a dairy-free whipped topping and vegan butter.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Is there a substitute I can use instead of Cool Whip?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>You can whip cream in place of the Cool Whip topping.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How should I store leftovers?</p>

<h2>Recipe Name: The Ultimate Breakfast Sandwich

		</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>14</p>
<p><strong>FAQs:</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can I use a different kind of bread for this sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>I mean, you could… but also a buttery toasted croissant here is just TOO GOOD. An English muffin would work great here in a pinch as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>What other sauces could I use?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Magic Green Sauce would also be a REAL WIN here. Salsa. Your favorite hot sauce. Whatever you like to top on your eggs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>What could I serve this with for brunch?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>A delicious simple arugula or mixed greens salad with vinaigrette would be great here. Also: fruit, juice and/or mimosas, pastries of some kind, and (obviously) lots of coffee.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How could I make this vegetarian?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Just omit the bacon! Maybe even replace with roasted mushrooms!? Yum.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Could I freeze this breakfast sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>This is more of a fresh, slow weekend morning kind of breakfast sandwich. If you’re looking for something to prep ahead and freeze, take a look at our Meal Prep Breakfast Sandwiches with some easy sheet pan eggs.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Featured Comment:</strong>This is a wonderful sandwich! And the tomato garlic sauce is really a find. I’ll use it in so many ways. All the flavors in this sandwich shine through and go perfectly together. This recipe is definitely a keeper.</p>
<h2>Recipe Name: Spicy Falafel And Roasted Veggie Naan-Wich</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>31</p>
<p><strong>Featured Comment:</strong>Loved this! Lots of parts to make separately- sauces, filafal, and vegetables – but none of them were hard. I actually liked it just fine with just the magic green sauce!</p>
<h2>Recipe Name: Italian Tomato And Bread Soup</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>11</p>
<p><strong>FAQs:</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How should I store or serve leftovers of this soup?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>This soup will do okay as leftovers in the fridge for 1 day. It can still be eaten, enjoyed, and not too soggy. If you’re sensitive to texture, make the tomato base and add the bread about 10 minutes before serving the soup.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Do you recommend fresh or dried herbs for this soup?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Fresh is the way to go here, if you can find them in the store.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How can I make this soup vegan?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Just use a vegan Parm cheese, if you plan to add that in, and use veggie broth.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Featured Comment:</strong>This was amazing, will be adding this to the rotation for sure, and so easy!!!</p>
<h2>Recipe Name: Thai Coconut Soup With Tofu And Rice</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>43</p>
<p><strong>FAQs:</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can I use a different protein?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Absolutely! Chicken or shrimp in this soup would be really good.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How can I make this vegan?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Fish sauce and chili paste are the only non-vegan ingredients in this soup. You could either purchase a vegan fish sauce (typically found at health-food stores) or use soy sauce (to taste) in place of the fish sauce. You could omit the chili paste or use a fresh Thai chili instead.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Any subs for lemongrass?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>If lemongrass is a hard-to-find ingredient for you, a bit of lemon zest can work in a pinch.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Is this soup spicy?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>There’s lots and lots of flavor in this soup plus some heat, but it’s not super spicy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can I use regular chili powder instead of ancho chili powder?</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>What else, besides the fritters, can I serve with this soup?</p>

<h2>Recipe Name: The Best Easy Pasta Salad</h2>
<p><strong>No.of reviews:</strong>106</p>
<p><strong>FAQs:</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>How long will this prepared pasta salad stay good in the fridge?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Keep any leftovers in the fridge for 2-3 days in a sealed container.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can this pasta salad be prepped ahead of time?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>Yes! And in fact, I recommend it! This tastes especially delicious when the flavors get to linger all together for a bit. I’d make it 12-24 hours ahead of time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>Can I use other veggies and extras in this pasta salad?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>By all means, customize this salad – that’s what it does best! Try adding blanched green beans, fresh spinach, artichokes, red bell peppers, chickpeas, broccoli, etc. for a more veg-forward version. Or different types of cheese (feta cheese? parmesan cheese?), or different shapes of pasta (penne? fusili? maybe even some tortellini?)… the possibilities are endless. I love this salad as-is but I also love its flexibility!</p>
</div>
